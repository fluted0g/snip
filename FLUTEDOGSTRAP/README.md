#### ABOUT FLUTEDOGSTRAP:
This is a custom css framework for myself. Mostly made for training my skills, and understanding better some design concepts.
An yes, the project name is not original at all :sweat_smile:

#### TO DO LIST:
* Grids are needed (at least one with flexbox).
* Some Hero Shot elements would be nice.
* Maybe templates for blogs, image galleries, video showcases... etc
* Need VARS for almost everything so it is easily customizable just changing the _vars.scss file then compiling.
* Should refactor NAV (no need for UL/LI tags).
* Forms are not finished. Need a way to make them adapt to different layouts (various types of forms would be lots of code).
* Lists are just standard (some variants would be nice, same with footer).
* Not responsive at all yet.
* No javascript yet, should use it to improve performance and some dynamic elements(but try to minimize the usage). And just vanilla JS!
* Once done, should think about making it modular (for performance)
