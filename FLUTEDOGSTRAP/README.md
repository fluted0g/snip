Â·GENERAL NOTES:
	-Grids are needed (at least one with flexbox).
	-Need VARS for almost everything so it is easily customizable just changing the _vars.scss file then compiling.
	-Should refactor NAV (no need for UL/LI tags).
	-Forms are not finished. Need a way to make them adapt to different layouts (various types of forms would be lots of code).
	-Lists are just standard (some variants would be nice, same with footer).
	-Not responsive at all yet.
	-No javascript yet, should use it to improve performance and some dynamic elements(but try to minimize the usage). And just vanilla JS!
